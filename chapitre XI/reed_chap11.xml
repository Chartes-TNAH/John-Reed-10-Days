               DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA <ref target="#XI_2">(See App. XI, Sect. 2)</ref>
            
               <p>... The first Congress of Soviets, in June of this year, proclaimed the right
                  of the peoples of Russia to self-determination.</p>
            
               <p>The second Congress of Soviets, in November last, confirmed this inalienable
                  right of the peoples of Russia more decisively and definitely.</p>
            
               <p>Executing the will of these Congresses, the Council of People's 
                  Commissars has resolved to establish as a basis for its activity 
                  in the question of Nationalities, the following principles:</p>
            
               <list>
                  <item>(1) The equality and sovereignty of the peoples of Russia.</item>
            
                  <item>(2) The right of the peoples of Russia to free self-determination,
                     even to the point of separation and the formation of an independent state.</item>
            
                  <item>(3) The abolition of any and all national and national religious
                     privileges and disabilities.</item>
            
                  <item>(4) The free development of national minorities and ethnographic 
                     groups inhabiting the territory of Russia.</item>
               </list>
               
               <p>Decrees will be prepared immediately upon the formation of a Commission
                  on Nationalities.</p>
            
               <p>In the name of the Russian Republic,</p>
            
               <p>People's Commissar for Nationalities</p>

               <p>President of the Council of People's Commissars</p>
            
               <p><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">V. ULIANOV (LENIN)</persName></p>
            </quote>
            
            
         <p>The Central Rada at Kiev immediately declared Ukraine an independent Republic, as did
            the Government of Finland, through the Senate at Helsingfors. Independent "Governments"
            spring up in Siberia and the Caucasus. The Polish Chief Military Committee swiftly
            gathered together the Polish troops in the Russian army, abolished their Committees and
            established an iron discipline....</p>

         <p>All these "Governments" and "movements" had two characteristics in common; they were
            controlled by the propertied classes, and they feared and detested Bolshevism....</p>

         <p>Steadily, amid the chaos of shocking change, the Council of People's Commissars hammered
            at the scaffolding of the Socialist order. Decree on Social Insurance, on Workers'
            Control, Regulations for Volost Land Committees, Abolition of Ranks and Titles,
            Abolition of Courts and the Creation of People's Tribunals.... 
            <ref target="#XI_3">(See App. XI, Sect. 3)</ref></p>

         <p>Army after army, fleet after fleet, sent deputations, "joyfully to greet the new
            Government of the People."</p>

         <p>In front of Smolny, one day, I saw a ragged regiment just come from the trenches. The
            soldiers were drawn up before the great gates, thin and grey-faced, looking up at the
            building as if God were in it. Some pointed out the Imperial eagles over the door,
            laughing.... Red Guards came to mount guard. All the soldiers turned to look, curiously,
            as if they had heard of them but never seen them. They laughed good-naturedly and
            pressed out of line to slap the Red Guards on the back, with half-joking, half-admiring
            remarks....</p>

         <p>The Provisional Government was no more. On November 15th, in all the churches of the
            capital, the priests stopped praying for it. But as <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">
           <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">Lenin</persName></persName> himself told the<foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign>,
            that was "only the beginning of the conquest of power." Deprived of arms, the
            opposition, which still controlled the economic life of the country, settled down to
            organise disorganisation, with all the Russian genius for cooperative action-to
            obstruct, cripple and discredit the Soviets.</p>

         <p>The strike of Government employees was well organised, financed by the banks and
            commercial establishments. Every move of the Bolsheviki
            to take over the Government apparatus was resisted.</p>

            <p><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33391">Trotzky</persName> went to 
            the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the functionaries refused to recognise
            him, locked themselves in, and when the doors were forced, resigned. He demanded the
            keys of the archives; only when he brought workmen to force the locks were they given
            up. Then it was discovered that <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4317434">Neratov</persName>, 
            former assistant Foreign Minister, had disappeared with the Secret Treaties....</p>

            <p><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q924379">Shliapnikov</persName>
            tried to take possession of the Ministry of Labour. It was bitterly cold,
            and there was no one to light the fires. Of all the hundreds of employees, not one would
            show him where the office of the Minister was....</p>

            <p><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q179558">Alexandra Kollontai</persName>, 
            appointed the 13th of November Commissar of Public Welfare the
            department of charities and public institutions was welcomed with a strike of all but
            forty of the functionaries in the Ministry. Immediately the poor of the great cities,
            the inmates of institutions, were plunged in miserable want: delegations of starving
            cripples, of orphans with blue, pinched faces, besieged the building. With tears
            streaming down her face, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q179558">Kollontai</persName>
            arrested the strikers until they should deliver the
            keys of the office and the safe; when she got the keys, however, it was discovered that
            the former Minister, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1993147">Countess Panina</persName>,
            had gone off with all the funds, which she refused
            to surrender except on the order of the Constituent Assembly. <ref target="#XI_4">(See App. XI, Sect. 4)</ref></p>

         <p>In the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Supplies, the Ministry of Finance,
            similar incidents occurred. And the employees, summoned to return or forfeit their
            positions and their pensions, either stayed away or returned to sabotage.... Almost all
            the intelligentzia being anti-Bolshevik, there was nowhere for the Soviet Government to
            recruit new staffs....</p>

         <p>The private banks remained stubbornly closed, with a back door open for speculators.
            When Bolshevik Commissars entered, the clerks left, secreting the books and removing the
            funds. All the employees of the State Bank struck except the clerks in charge of the
            vaults and the manufacture of money, who refused all demands from Smolny and privately
            paid out huge sums to the Committee for Salvation and the City Duma.</p>

         <p>Twice a Commissar, with a company of Red Guards, came formally to insist upon the
            delivery of large sums for Government expenses. The first time, the City Duma members
            and the Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary leaders were present in imposing numbers,
            and spoke so gravely of the consequences that the Commissar was frightened. The second
            time he arrived with a warrant, which he proceeded to read aloud in due form; but some
            one called his attention to the fact that it had no date and no seal, and the
            traditional Russian respect for "documents" forced him again to withdraw....</p>

         <p>The officials of the Credit Chancery destroyed their books, so that all record of the
            financial relations of Russia with foreign countries was lost.</p>

         <p>The Supply Committees, the administrations of the Municipal-owned public utilities,
            either did not work at all, or sabotaged. And when the Bolsheviki, compelled by the
            desperate needs of the city population, attempted to help or to control the public
            service, all the employees went on strike immediately, and the Duma flooded Russia with
            telegrams about Bolshevik "violation of Municipal autonomy."</p>

         <p>At Military headquarters, and in the offices of the Ministries of War and Marine, where
            the old officials had consented to work, the Army Committees and the high command
            blocked the Soviets in every way possible, even to the extent of neglecting the troops
            at the front. The <foreign xml:lang="ru">Vikzhel</foreign> was hostile, refusing to transport Soviet troops; every
            troop-train that left Petrograd was taken out by force, and railway officials had to be
            arrested each time-whereupon the<foreign xml:lang="ru">Vikzhel</foreign> threatened 
            an immediate general strike unless they were released....</p>

         <p>Smolny was plainly powerless. The newspapers said that all the factories of Petrograd
            must shut down for lack of fuel in three weeks; the<foreign xml:lang="ru">Vikzhel</foreign> announced that trains must
            cease running by December first; there was food for three days only in Petrograd, and no
            more coming in; and the Army on the Front was starving.... The Committee for Salvation,
            the various Central Committees, sent word all over the country, exhorting the population
            to ignore the Government decrees. And the Allied Embassies were either coldly
            indifferent, or openly hostile....</p>

         <p>The opposition newspapers, suppressed one day and reappearing next morning under new
            names, heaped bitter sarcasm on the new regime. <ref target="#XI_5">(See App. XI, Sect. 5)</ref>
            Even <title>Novaya Zhizn</title> characterised it as "a combination of demagoguery and impotence."</p>

         <p>From day to day (it said) the Government of the People's Commissars sinks deeper and
            deeper into the mire of superficial haste. Having easily conquered the power... the
            Bolsheviki can not make use of it.</p>

         <p>Powerless to direct the existing mechanism of Government, they are unable at the same
            time to create a new one which might work easily and freely according to the theories of
            social experimenters.</p>

         <p>Just a little while ago the Bolsheviki hadn't enough men to run their growing party-a
            work above all of speakers and writers; where then are they going to find trained men to
            execute the diverse and complicated functions of government?</p>

         <p>The new Government acts and threatens, it sprays the country with decrees, each one more
            radical and more "socialist" than the last. But in this exhibition of Socialism on
            Paper-more likely designed for the stupefaction of our descendants-there appears neither
            the desire nor the capacity to solve the immediate problems of the day!</p>

         <p>Meanwhile the<foreign xml:lang="ru">Vikzhel</foreign>'s Conference to Form a New Government continued to meet night and
            day. Both sides had already agreed in principle to the basis of the Government; the
            composition of the People's Council was being discussed; the Cabinet was tentatively
            chosen, with Tchernov as Premier; the Bolsheviki were admitted in a large minority, but
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">Lenin</persName> and 
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33391">Trotzky</persName> were barred. 
            The Central Committees of the Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary parties, 
            the Executive Committee of the Peasant's Soviets, resolved that,
            although unalterably opposed to the "criminal politics" of the Bolsheviki, they would,
            "in order to halt the fratricidal bloodshed," not oppose their entrance into the
            People's Council.</p>

         <p>The flight of <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q48211">Kerensky</persName>, 
            however, and the astounding success of the Soviets everywhere,
            altered the situation. On the 16th, in a meeting of the <foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign>, the Left Socialist
            Revolutionaries insisted that the Bolsheviki should form a coalition Government with the
            other Socialist parties; otherwise they would withdraw from the Military Revolutionary
            Committee and the<foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign>. Malkin said, "The news from Moscow, where our comrades
            are dying on both sides of the barricades, determines us to bring up once more the
            question of organisation of power, and it is not only our right to do so, but our
            duty.... We have won the right to sit with the Bolsheviki here within the walls of
            Smolny Institute, and to speak from this tribune. After the bitter internal party
            struggle, we shall be obliged, if you refuse to compromise, to pass to open battle
            outside.... We must propose to the democracy terms of an acceptable compromise...."</p>

         <p>After a recess to consider this ultimatum, the Bolsheviki returned with a resolution,
            read by <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q165854">Kameniev</persName>:</p>
            
            <quote>
                <p>The<foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign>
                   considers it necessary that there enter into the Government
                   representatives of <emph rend="italic">all the Socialist parties composing the Soviets of Workers',
                   Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies who recognise the conquests of the Revolution of
                   November 7th-that is to say, the establishment of a Government of Soviets, the decrees
                   on peace, land, workers' control over industry, and the arming of the working-class</emph>. The
                  <foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign> therefore resolves to propose negotiations 
                   concerning the constitution of the Government to all parties of the Soviet, 
                   and insists upon the following conditions as a basis:</p>
       
                <p>The Government is responsible to the<foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign> . 
                   The<foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign>  shall be enlarged to
                   150 members. To these 150 delegates of the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies
                   shall be added 75 delegates of the Provincial Soviets of Peasants' Deputies, 80 from the
                   Front organisations of the Army and Navy, 40 from the Trade Unions (25 from the various
                   All-Russian Unions, in proportion to their importance, 10 from the<foreign xml:lang="ru">Vikzhel</foreign>, and 5 from
                   the Post and Telegraph Workers), and 50 delegates from the Socialist groups in the
                   Petrograd City Duma. In the Ministry itself, at least one-half the portfolios must be
                   reserved to the Bolsheviki. The Ministries of Labour, Interior and Foreign Affairs must
                   be given to the Bolsheviki. The command of the garrisons of Petrograd and Moscow must
                   remain in the hands of delegates of the Moscow and Petrograd Soviets.</p>
       
                <p>The Government undertakes the systematic arming of the workers of all Russia.</p>
             
                <p>It is resolved to insist upon the candidature of comrades 
                   <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">Lenin</persName> and

            Council' anyway; the Soviets are open to all Socialist parties, and the<foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign>
            represents them in their real proportions among the masses...."</said></p>

         <p><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4214882">Karelin</persName>, 
            for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, declared that his party would vote for
            the Bolshevik resolution, reserving the right to modify certain details, such as the
            representation of the peasants, and demanding that the Ministry of Agriculture be
            reserved for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. This was agreed to....</p>

         <p>Later, at a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet, 
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33391">Trotzky</persName> answered a question about the
            formation of the new Government:</p>

         <p><said who="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33391">"I don't know anything about that.
            I am not taking part in the negotiations.... However,
            I don't think that they are of great importance...."</said></p>

         <p>That night there was great uneasiness in the Conference. The delegates of the City Duma
            withdrew....</p>

         <p>But at Smolny itself, in the ranks of the Bolshevik party, a formidable opposition to
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">Lenin</persName>'s policy was
            growing. On the night of November 17th the great hall was packed and
            ominous for the meeting of the<foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign>.</p>

         <p><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">Larin</persName>, Bolshevik,
            declared that the moment of elections to the Constituent Assembly
            approached, and it was time to do away with "political terrorism."</p>

         <p>"The measures taken against the freedom of the press should be modified. They had their
            reason during the struggle, but now they have no further excuse. The press should be
            free, except for appeals to riot and insurrection."</p>

         <p>In a storm of hisses and hoots from his own party, 
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">Larin</persName> offered the following
            resolution:</p>
            
            <quote>
                <p>The decree of the Council of
                   People's Commissars concerning the Press is herewith
                   repealed.</p>
       
                <p>Measures of political repression can only be employed subject to decision of a special
                   tribunal, elected by the<foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign> proportionally
                   to the strength of the different parties represented; and this tribunal shall 
                   have the right also to reconsider measures of repression already taken.</p>
            </quote>
            
         <p>This was met by a thunder of applause, not only from the Left Socialist Revolutionaries,
            but also from a part of the Bolsheviki.</p>

         <p><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4055364">Avanessov</persName>, for the
           <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">Lenin</persName>ites, hastily proposed that the question of the Press be
            postponed until after some compromise between the Socialist parties had been reached.
            Overwhelmingly voted down.</p>

         <p><said who="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4055364">"The revolution which is now being
            accomplished," <seg> went on Avanessov,</seg> "has not hesitated
            to attack private property; and it is as private property that we must examine the
            question of the Press...."</said></p>

         <p>Thereupon he read the official Bolshevik resolution:</p>
            
            <quote>
                 <p>The suppression of the bourgeois
                    press was dictated not only by purely military needs in
                    the course of the insurrection, and for the checking of counter-revolutionary action,
                    but it is also necessary as a measure of transition toward the establishment of a new
                    régime with regard to the Press-a régime under which the capitalist owners of
                    printing-presses and of paper cannot be the all-powerful and exclusive manufacturers of
                    public opinion.</p>
        
                 <p>We must further proceed to the
                    confiscation of private printing plants and supplies of
                    paper, which should become the property of the Soviets, both in the capital and in the
                    provinces, so that the political parties and groups can make use of the facilities of
                    printing in proportion to the actual strength of the ideas they represent-in other
                    words, proportionally to the number of their constituents.</p>
        
                 <p>The restablishment of the so-called "freedom of the press," the simple return of
                    printing presses and paper to the capitalists,-poisoners of the mind of the people-this
                    would be an inadmissible surrender to the will of capital, a giving up of one of the
                    most important conquests of the Revolution; in other words, it would be a measure of
                    unquestionably counter-revolutionary character.</p>
        
                 <p>Proceeding from the above, the 
                   <foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign> categorically rejects all propositions aiming
                    at the restablishment of the old régime in the domain of the Press, and unequivocally
                    supports the point of view of the Council of People's Commissars on this question,
                    against pretentions and ultimatums dictated by petty bourgeois prejudices, or by evident
                    surrender to the interests of the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie.</p>
            </quote>
            
         <p>The reading of this resolution was interrupted by ironical shouts from the Left
            Socialist Revolutionaries, and bursts of indignation from the insurgent Bolsheviki.
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4214882">Karelin</persName> was on 
            his feet, protesting. <said who="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4214882">"Three weeks ago
            the Bolsheviki were the most ardent defenders of the freedom of the Press... The 
            arguments in this resolution suggest singularly the point of view of the old Black
            Hundreds and the censors of the Tsarist régime for they also talked of 'poisoners
            of the mind of the people.'"</said></p>

         <p><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33391">Trotzky</persName> spoke at 
            length in favour of the resolution. He distinguished between the Press
            during the civil war, and the Press after the victory. 
            <said who="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33391">"During civil war the right to
            use violence belongs only to the oppressed...."</said> (Cries of "Who's the oppressed now?
            Cannibal!").</p>

         <p><said who="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33391">"The victory over our adversaries is 
            not yet achieved, and the newspapers are arms in their hands. 
            In these conditions, the closing of the newspapers is a legitimate measure
            of defence...."</said> Then passing to the question of the Press after the victory, Trotzky
            continued:</p>

         <p><said who="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33391">"The attitude of Socialists on 
            the question of freedom of the Press should be the same
            as their attitude toward the freedom of business.... The rule of the democracy which is
            being established in Russia demands that the domination of the Press by private property
            must be abolished, just as the domination of industry by private property.... The power
            of the Soviets should confiscate all printing-plants."</said> (Cries, "Confiscate the
            printing-shop of Pravda!")</p>

         <p><said who="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33391">"The monopoly of the Press by
            the bourgeoisie must be abolished. Otherwise it isn't
            worth while for us to take the power! Each group of citizens should have access to print
            shops and paper.... The ownership of print-type and of paper belongs first to the
            workers and peasants, and only afterwards to the bourgeois parties, which are in a
            minority.... The passing of the power into the hands of the Soviets will bring about a
            radical transformation of the essential conditions of existence, and this transformation
            will necessarily be evident in the Press.... If we are going to nationalise the banks,
            can we then tolerate the financial journals? The old régime must die; that must be
            understood once and for all...." Applause and angry cries.</said></p>

         <p><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4214882">Karelin</persName> declared 
            that the<foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign> had no right to pass upon this important question,
            which should be left to a special committee. Again, passionately, he demanded that the
            Press be free.</p>

         <p>Then <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">Lenin</persName>, calm, 
            unemotional, his forehead wrinkled, as he spoke slowly, choosing his
            words; each sentence falling like a hammer-blow. 
            <said who="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">"The civil war is not yet finished; the
            enemy is still with us; consequently it is impossible to abolish the measures of
            repression against the Press.</said></p>

         <p><said who="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">"We Bolsheviki have always
            said that when we reached a position of power we would close
            the bourgeois press. To tolerate the bourgeois newspapers would mean to cease being a
            Socialist. When one makes a Revolution, one cannot mark time; one must always go
            forward-or go back. He who now talks about the 'freedom of the Press' goes backward, and
            halts our headlong course toward Socialism.</said></p>

         <p><said who="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">"We have thrown off the yoke 
            of capitalism, just as the first revolution threw off the
            yoke of Tsarism. <emph rend="italic ">If the first revolution had the right to suppress the Monarchist
            papers</emph>, then we have the right to suppress the bourgeois press. It is impossible to
            separate the question of the freedom of the Press from the other questions of the class
            struggle. We have promised to close these newspapers, and we shall do it. The immense
            majority of the people is with us!</said></p>

         <p><said who="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">"Now that the insurrection is over, 
            we have absolutely no desire to suppress the papers
            of the other Socialist parties, except inasmuch as they appeal to armed insurrection, or
            to disobedience to the Soviet Government. However, we shall not permit them, under the
            pretence of freedom of the Socialist press, to obtain, through the secret support of the
            bourgeoisie, a monopoly of printing-presses, ink and paper.... These essentials must
            become the property of the Soviet Government, and be apportioned, first of all, to the
            Socialist parties in strict proportion to their voting strength...."</said></p>

         <p>Then the vote. The resolution of <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">Lenin</persName> 
            and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries was
            defeated by 31 to 22; the <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">Lenin</persName>
            motion was carried by 34 to 24. Among the minority were
            the Bolsheviki <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q597991">Riazanov</persName>
            and <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q947865">Lozovsky</persName>, 
            who declared that it was impossible for them to
            vote against any restriction on the freedom of the Press.</p>

         <p>Upon this the Left Socialist Revolutionaries declared they could no longer be
            responsible for what was being done, and withdrew from the Military Revolutionary
            Committee and all other positions of executive responsibility.</p>

                  <p>We are in favour of a Socialist Government composed of all the parties in the Soviets.
                  We consider that only the creation of such a Government can possibly guarantee the
                  results of the heroic struggle of the working-class and the revolutionary army. Outside
                  of that, there remains only one way: the constitution of a purely Bolshevik Government
                  by means of political terrorism. This last is the road taken by the Council of People's
                  Commissars. We cannot and will not follow it. We see that this leads directly to the
                  elimination from political life of many proletarian organisations, to the establishment
                  of an irresponsible régime, and to the destruction of the Revolution and the country. We
                  cannot take the responsibility for such a policy, and we renounce before the

                <p>... The constitution of such a Government (composed of all the parties of the Soviet) is
                   indispensable to prevent a new flow of blood, the coming famine, the destruction of the
                   Revolution by the Kaledinists, to assure the convocation of the Constituent Assembly at
                   the proper time, and to apply effectively the programme adopted by the Congress of
                   Soviets....</p>
       
                <p>We cannot accept the responsibility for the disastrous policy of the Central Committee,
                   carried on against the will of an enormous majority of the proletariat and the soldiers,
                   who are eager to see the rapid end of the bloodshed between the different political
                   parties of the democracy.... We renounce our title as members of the Central Committee,
                   in order to be able to say openly our opinion to the masses of workers and
                   soldiers....</p>
       
                <p>We leave the Central Committee at the moment of victory; we cannot calmly look on while
                   the policy of the chiefs of the Central Committee leads toward the loss of the fruits of

         <p>The masses of the workers, the soldiers of the garrison, stirred restlessly, sending
            their delegations to Smolny, to the Conference for Formation of the New Government,
            where the break in the ranks of the Bolsheviki caused the liveliest joy.</p>

         <p>But the answer of the<persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">Lenin</persName>ites was swift and ruthless.

                  entrusted to them, but also disobeyed the direct instructions of the Central Committee
                  of our party, to the effect that they should await the decisions of the Petrograd and
                  Moscow party organisations before retiring. We blame decisively such desertion. We are
                  firmly convinced that all conscious workers, soldiers and peasants, belonging to our
                  party or sympathising with it, will also disapprove of the behaviour of the
                  deserters....</p>
      
               <p>Remember, comrades, that two of these deserters, 
                  <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q165854">Kameniev</persName> and 
                  <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q207459">Zinoviev</persName>, even before the
                  uprising in Petrograd, appeared as deserters and strike-breakers, by voting at the
                  decisive meeting of the Central Committee, October 23d, 1917, against the insurrection;
                  and even AFTER the resolution passed by the Central Committee, they continued their
                  campaign at a meeting of the party workers.... But the great impulse of the masses, the
                  great heroism of millions of workers, soldiers and peasants, in Moscow, Petrograd, at
                  the front, in the trenches, in the villages, pushed aside the deserters as a railway
                  train scatters saw-dust....</p>
      
               <p>Shame upon those who are of little faith, hesitate, who doubt, who allow themselves to
                  be frightened by the bourgeoisie, or who succumb before the cries of the latter's direct
                  or indirect accomplices! There is NOT A SHADOW of hesitation in the MASSES of Petrograd,
                  Moscow, and the rest of Russia....</p>
      
               <p>... We shall not submit to any ultimatums from small groups of intellectuals which are
                  not followed by the masses, which are PRACTICALLY only supported by Kornilovists,
                  Savinkovists, <foreign xml:lang="ru">yunkers</foreign>, and so forth....</p>
            </quote>
            
         <p>The response from the whole country was like a blast of hot storm. The insurgents never
            got a chance to "say openly their opinion to the masses of workers and soldiers." Upon
            the<foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign> rolled in like breakers the fierce popular condemnation of the
            "deserters." For days Smolny was thronged with angry delegations and committees, from
            the front, from the Volga, from the Petrograd factories. "Why did they dare leave the
            Government? Were they paid by the bourgeoisie to destroy the Revolution? They must
            return and submit to the decisions of the Central Committee!"</p>

         <p>Only in the Petrograd garrison was there still uncertainty. A great soldier meeting was
            held on November 24th, addressed by representatives of all the political parties. By a
            vast majority <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">Lenin</persName>'s
            policy was sustained, and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries were
            told that they must enter the government.... <emph rend="italic">See next page</emph>.</p>

         <p>The Mensheviki delivered a final ultimatum, demanding that all Ministers and 
            <foreign xml:lang="ru">yunkers</foreign> be
            released, that all newspapers be allowed full freedom, that the Red Guard be disarmed
            and the garrison put under command of the Duma. To this Smolny answered that all the
            Socialist Ministers and also all but a very few <foreign xml:lang="ru">yunkers</foreign>
            had been already set free, that
            all newspapers were free except the bourgeois press, and that the Soviet would remain in
            command of the armed forces.... On the 19th the Conference to Form a New Government
            disbanded, and the opposition one by one slipped away to Moghilev, where, under the wing
            of the General Staff, they continued to form Government after Government, until the
            end....</p>

         <p>Announcement, posted on the walls of Petrograd, of the result of a meeting of
            representatives of the garrison regiments, called to consider the question of forming a
            new Government. For translation see <ref target="#XI_6">App. XI, Sect. 6.</ref></p>

         <p>Meanwhile the Bolsheviki had been undermining the power of the
            <foreign xml:lang="ru">Vikzhel</foreign>. An appeal of the
            Petrograd Soviet to all railway workers called upon them to 
            force the<foreign xml:lang="ru">Vikzhel</foreign> to
            surrender its powers. On the 15th, the<foreign xml:lang="ru">
               Tsay-ee-kah</foreign>, following its procedure toward the
            peasants, called an All-Russian Congress of Railway Workers for December 1st; the
           <foreign xml:lang="ru">Vikzhel</foreign> immediately called its own Congress for two weeks later. On November 16th, the
           <foreign xml:lang="ru">Vikzhel</foreign> members took their seats in the
            <foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign>. On the night of December 2d, at the
            opening session of the All-Russian Congress of Railway Workers, the
            <foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign> formally
            offered the post of Commissar of Ways and Communications to the
            <foreign xml:lang="ru">Vikzhel</foreign>-which
            accepted....</p>

         <p>Having settled the question of power, the Bolsheviki turned their attention to problems
            of practical administration. First of all the city, the country, the Army must be fed.
            Bands of sailors and Red Guards scoured the warehouses, the railway terminals, even the
            barges in the canals, unearthing and confiscating thousands of 
            <foreign xml:lang="ru">poods</foreign> 1 of food held by
            private speculators. Emissaries were sent to the provinces, where with the assistance of
            the Land Committees they seized the store-houses of the great grain-dealers. Expeditions
            of sailors, heavily armed, were sent out in groups of five thousand, to the South, to
            Siberia, with roving commissions to capture cities still held by the White Guards,
            establish order, and get food. Passenger traffic on the Trans-Siberian Railroad was
            suspended for two weeks, while thirteen trains, loaded with bolts of cloth and bars of
            iron assembled by the Factory-Shop Committees, were sent out eastward, each in charge of
            a Commissar, to barter with the Siberian peasants for grain and potatoes....</p>

         <p><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q944910">Kaledin</persName> being in
            possession of the coal-mines of the Don, the fuel question became
            urgent. Smolny shut off all electric lights in theatres, shops and restaurants, cut down
            the number of street cars, and confiscated the private stores of fire-wood held by the
            fuel-dealers.... And when the factories of Petrograd were about to close down for lack
            of coal, the sailors of the Baltic Fleet turned over to the workers two hundred thousand
            poods from the bunkers of battle-ships....</p>

         <p>Toward the end of November occurred the "wine-pogroms" 
            <ref target="#XI_7">(See App. XI, Sect. 7)</ref>-looting of
            the wine-cellars-beginning with the plundering of the Winter Palace vaults. For days
            there were drunken soldiers on the streets.... In all this was evident the hand of the
            counter-revolutionists, who distributed among the regiments plans showing the location
            of the stores of liquor. The Commissars of Smolny began by pleading and arguing, which
            did not stop the growing disorder, followed by pitched battles between soldiers and Red
            Guards.... Finally the Military Revolutionary Committee sent out companies of sailors
            with machine-guns, who fired mercilessly upon the rioters, killing many; and by
            executive order the wine-cellars were invaded by Committees with hatchets, who smashed
            the bottles-or blew them up with dynamite....</p>

         <p>Companies of Red Guards, disciplined and well-paid, were on duty at the headquarters of
            the Ward Soviets day and night, replacing the old Militia. In all quarters of the city
            small elective Revolutionary Tribunals were set up by the workers and soldiers to deal
            with petty crime....</p>

         <p>The great hotels, where the speculators still did a thriving business, were surrounded
            by Red Guards, and the speculators thrown into jail. <ref target="#XI_8">(See App. XI, Sect. 8)</ref>...</p>

         <p>Alert and suspicious, the working-class of the city constituted itself a vast spy
            system, through the servants prying into bourgeois households, and reporting all
            information to the Military Revolutionary Committee, which struck with an iron hand,
            unceasing. In this way was discovered the Monarchist plot led by former Duma-member
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q545353">Purishkevitch</persName>
            and a group of nobles and officers, who had planned an officers' uprising,
            and had written a letter inviting <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q944910">Kaledin</persName>
            to Petrograd. <ref target="#XI_9">(See App. XI, Sect. 9)</ref>.... In
            this way was unearthed the conspiracy of the Petrograd Cadets, who were sending money
            and recruits to <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q944910">Kaledin</persName>....</p>

        <p><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4317434">Neratov</persName>, 
            frightened at the outburst of popular fury provoked by his flight, returned and
            surrendered the Secret Treaties to <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33391">Trotzky</persName>, 
            who began their publication in <title>Pravda</title>, scandalising the world....</p>

         <p>Bolshevik order. A proclamation of the Committee to Fight against Pogroms, attached to
            the Petrograd Soviet. For translation see <ref target="#XI_11">App. XI, Sect. 11</ref>.</p>

         <p>The restrictions on the Press were increased by a decree <ref target="#XI_10">(See App. XI, Sect. 10)</ref> making
            advertisements a monopoly of the official Government newspaper. At this all the other
            papers suspended publication as a protest, or disobeyed the law and were closed.... Only
            three weeks later did they finally submit.</p>

         <p>Still the strike of the Ministries went on, still the sabotage of the old officials, the
            stoppage of normal economic life. Behind Smolny was only the will of the vast,
            unorganised popular masses; and with them the Council of People's Commissars dealt,
            directing revolutionary mass-action against its enemies. In eloquent proclamations, <ref target="#XI_12">(See
            App. XI, Sect. 12)</ref> couched in simple words and spread over Russia,
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">Lenin</persName> explained the
            Revolution, urged the people to take the power into their own hands, by force to break
            down the resistance of the propertied classes, by force to take over the institutions of
            Government. Revolutionary order. Revolutionary discipline! Strict accounting and
            control! No strikes! No loafing!</p>

         <p>Appeal of the Petrograd Soviet, the Petrograd Council of Professional Unions, and the
            Petrograd Council of Factory Shop Committees, to the Workers of Petro. grad, urging them
            to work hard and not to strike. For translation see <ref target="#XI_13">App. XI, Sect. 13</ref>.</p>

         <p>On the 20th of November the Military Revolutionary Committee issued a warning:</p>
            
            <quote>
               <p>The rich classes oppose the power of the Soviets-the Government of workers, soldiers and
                  peasants. Their sympathisers halt the work of the employees of the Government and the
                  Duma, incite strikes in the banks, try to interrupt communication by the railways, the
                  post and the telegraph....</p>
      
               <p>We warn them that they are playing with fire. The country and the Army are threatened
                  with famine. To fight against it, the regular functioning of all services is
                  indispensable. The Workers' and Peasants' Government is taking every measure to assure
                  the country and the Army all that is necessary. Opposition to these measures is a crime
                  against the People. We warn the rich classes and their sympathisers that, if they do not
                  cease their sabotage and their provocation in halting the transportation of food, they
                  will be the first to suffer. They will be deprived of the right of receiving food. All
                  the reserves which they possess will be requisitioned. The property of the principal
                  criminals will be confiscated.</p>
      
               <p>We have done our duty in warning those who play with fire.</p>
      
               <p>We are convinced that in case decisive measures become necessary, we shall be solidly
                  supported by all workers, soldiers, and peasants.</p>
            </quote>
            
         <p>On the 22d of November the walls of the city were placarded with a sheet headed
            "EXTRAORDINARY COMMUNICATION":</p>
            
            <quote>
               <p>The Council of People's Commissars has received an urgent telegram from the Staff of the
                  Northern Front....</p>
      
               <p>"There must be no further delay; do not let the Army die of hunger; the armies of the
                  Northern Front have not received a crust of bread now for several days, and in two or
                  three days they will not have any more biscuits-which are being doled out to them from
                  reserve supplies until now never touched.... Already delegates from all parts of the
                  Front are talking of a necessary removal of part of the Army to the rear, foreseeing
                  that in a few days there will be headlong flight of the soldiers, dying from hunger,
                  ravaged by the three years' war in the trenches, sick, insufficiently clothed,
                  bare-footed, driven mad by superhuman misery."</p>
      
               <p>The Military Revolutionary Committee brings this to the notice of the Petrograd garrison
                  and the workers of Petrograd. The situation at the Front demands the most urgent and
                  decisive measures. ... Meanwhile the higher functionaries of the Government
                  institutions, banks, railroads, post and telegraph, are on strike and impeding the work
                  of the Government in supplying the Front with provisions.... Each hour of delay may cost
                  the life of thousands of soldiers. The counter-revolutionary functionaries are the most
                  dishonest criminals toward their hungry and dying brethren on the Front....</p>
      
               <p>The MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE GIVES THESE CRIMINALS A LAST WARNING. In event of
                  the least resistance or opposition on their part, the harshness of the measures which
                  will be adopted against them will correspond to the seriousness of their crime....</p>
            </quote>

         <p>The masses of workers and soldiers responded by a savage tremor of rage, which swept all
            Russia. In the capital the Government and bank employees got out hundreds of
            proclamations and appeals (See App. XI, Sect. 14), protesting, defending themselves,
            such as this one:</p>

            <quote>
              <p>TO THE ATTENTION OF ALL CITIZENS.</p>
     
              <p>THE STATE BANK IS CLOSED!</p>
     
              <p>WHY?</p>

               <p>Because the violence exercised by the Bolsheviki against the State Bank has made it
                  impossible for us to work. The first act of the People's Commissars was to DEMAND TEN
                  MILLION RUBLES, and on November 27th THEY DEMANDED TWENTY-FIVE MILLIONS, without any
                  indication as to where this money was to go.</p>
      
               <p>... We functionaries cannot take part in plundering the people's property. We stopped
                  work.</p>
      
               <p>CITIZENS! The money in the State Bank is yours, the people's money, acquired by your
                  labour, your sweat and blood. CITIZENS! Save the people's property from robbery, and us
                  from violence, and we shall immediately resume work.</p>
      
               <p>EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE BANK.</p>
            </quote>
            
         <p>From the Ministry of Supplies, the Ministry of Finance, from the Special Supply
            Committee, declarations that the Military Revolutionary Committee made it impossible for
            the employees to work, appeals to the population to support them against Smolny.... But
            the dominant worker and soldier did not believe them; it was firmly fixed in the popular
            mind that the employees were sabotaging, starving the Army, starving the people.... In
            the long bread lines, which as formerly stood in the iron winter streets, it was not <emph rend="italic">the
            Government</emph> which was blamed, as it had been under 
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q48211">Kerensky</persName>, 
            but the <foreign xml:lang="ru">tchinovniki</foreign>, the
            sabotageurs; for the Government was <emph rend="italic">their</emph> 
            Government, <emph rend="italic">their</emph> Soviets-and the
            functionaries of the Ministries were against it....</p>

         <p>At the centre of all this opposition was the Duma, and its militant organ, the Committee
            for Salvation, protesting against all the decrees of the Council of People's Commissars,
            voting again and again not to recognise the Soviet Government, openly cooperating with
            the new counter-revolutionary "Governments" set up at Moghilev.... On the 17th of
            November, for example, the Committee for Salvation addressed "all Municipal Governments,
            Zemstvos, and all democratic and revolutionary organisations of peasants, workers,
            soldiers and other citizens," in these words:</p>
            
            <quote>
               <p>Do not recognise the Government of the Bolsheviki, and struggle against it.</p>
      
               <p>Form local Committees for Salvation of Country and Revolution, who will unite all
                  democratic forces, so as to aid the All-Russian Committee for Salvation in the tasks
                  which it has set itself....</p>
            </quote>
            
         <p>Meanwhile the elections for the Constituent Assembly in Petrograd <ref target="#XI_15">(See App. XI, Sect.
            15)</ref> gave an enormous plurality to the Bolsheviki; so that even the Mensheviki
            Internationalists pointed out that the Duma ought to be re-elected, as it no longer
            represented the political composition of the Petrograd population.... At the same time
            floods of resolutions from workers' organisations, from military units, even from the
            peasants in the surrounding country, poured in upon the Duma, calling it
            "counter-revolutionary, Kornilovitz," and demanding that it resign. The last days of the
            Duma were stormy with the bitter demands of the Municipal workers for decent living
            wages, and the threat of strikes....</p>

         <p>On the 23d a formal decree of the Military Revolutionary Committee dissolved the
            Committee for Salvation. On the 29th, the Council of People's Commissars ordered the
            dissolution and re-election of the Petrograd City Duma:</p>

         <p>In view of the fact that the Central Duma of Petrograd, elected September 2d, ... has
            definitely lost the right to represent the population of Petrograd, being in complete
            disaccord with its state of mind and its aspirations ... and in view of the fact that
            the personnel of the Duma majority, although having lost all political following,
            continues to make use of its prerogatives to resist in a counter-revolutionary manner
            the will of the workers, soldiers and peasants, to sabotage and obstruct the normal work
            of the Government-the Council of People's Commissars considers it its duty to invite the
            population of the capital to pronounce judgment on the policy of the organ of Municipal
            autonomy.</p>

         <p>To this end the Council of People's Commissars resolves:</p>
            
            <quote><list>
                <item>(1) To dissolve the Municipal Duma; the dissolution to take effect November 30th,

         <p>The Duma met defiantly, passing resolutions to the effect that it would "defend its
            position to the last drop of its blood," and appealing desperately to the population to
            save their "own elected City Government." But the population remained indifferent or
            hostile. On the 31st Mayor <persName>Schreider</persName> and several members were arrested, interrogated,
            and released. That day and the next the Duma continued to meet, interrupted frequently
            by Red Guards and sailors, who politely requested the assembly to disperse. At the
            meeting of December 2d, an officer and some sailors entered the Nicolai Hall while a
            member was speaking, and ordered the members to leave, or force would be used. They did
            so, protesting to the last, but finally "ceding to violence."</p>

         <p>The new Duma, which was elected ten days later, and for which the "Moderate" Socialists
            refused to vote, was almost entirely Bolshevik....</p>

         <p>There remained several centres of dangerous opposition, such as the "republics" of
            Ukraine and Finland, which were showing definitely anti-Soviet tendencies. Both at
            Helsingfors and at Kiev the Governments were gathering troops which could be depended
            upon, and entering upon campaigns of crushing Bolshevism, and of disarming and expelling
            Russian troops. The Ukrainean Rada had taken command of all southern Russia, and was
            furnishing <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q944910">Kaledin</persName>
            reinforcements and supplies. Both Finland and Ukraine were beginning
            secret negotiations with the Germans, and were promptly recognised by the Allied
            Governments, which loaned them huge sums of money, joining with the propertied classes
            to create counter-revolutionary centres of attack upon Soviet Russia. In the end, when
            Bolshevism had conquered in both these countries, the defeated bourgeoisie called in the
            Germans to restore them to power....</p>

         <p>But the most formidable menace to the Soviet Government was internal and two-headed-the
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q944910">Kaledin</persName>
            movement, and the Staff at Moghilev, where 
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1356009">General Dukhonin</persName> had assumed command.</p>

         <p>Proclamation of the Commission of Public Education attached to the City Duma, concerning
            the strike of school-teachers, just before the Christmas holidays. The Duma had been
            re-elected, and was composed almost entirely of Bolsheviki. For translation see <ref target="#XI_17">App. XI,
            Sect. 17</ref>.</p>

         <p>The ubiquitous <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4307741">Muraviov</persName>
            was appointed commander of the war against the Cossacks, and a
            Red Army was recruited from among the factory workers. Hundreds of propagandists were
            sent to the Don. The Council of People's Commissars issued a proclamation to the
            Cossacks, <ref target="#XI_16">(See App. XI, Sect. 16)</ref> 
            explaining what the Soviet Government was, how the
            propertied classes, the <foreign xml:lang="ru">tchin ovniki</foreign>, 
            landlords, bankers and their allies, the Cossack
            princes, land-owners and Generals, were trying to destroy the Revolution, and prevent
            the confiscation of their wealth by the people.</p>

         <p>On November 27th a committee of Cossacks came to Smolny to see 
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33391">Trotzky</persName>and 
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">Lenin</persName>. They
            demanded if it were true that the Soviet Government did not intend to divide the Cossack
            lands among the peasants of Great Russia? <said who="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33391">"No,"</said>
            answered <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33391">Trotzky</persName>. 
            The Cossacks deliberated for a while. 
            <said>"Well," they asked, "does the Soviet Government intend to
            confiscate the estates of our great Cossack land-owners and divide them among the
            working Cossacks?"</said> To this <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">Lenin</persName>
            replied. <said who="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">"That," <seg>he said,</seg>
            "is for <emph rend="italic">you</emph> to do. We shall
            support the working Cossacks in all their actions.... The best way to begin is to form
            Cossacks Soviets; you will be given representation in the<foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign>, and then it will
            be <emph rend="italic">your</emph> Government, too....</said></p>

         <p>The Cossacks departed, thinking hard. Two weeks later General 
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q944910">Kaledin</persName>received a
            deputation from his troops. <said>"Will you," <seg>they asked,</seg> "promise to divide the great estates
            of the Cossack landlords among the working Cossacks?"</said></p>

         <p><said who="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q944910">"Only over my dead body,"</said> 
            responded <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q944910">Kaledin</persName>. 
            A month later, seeing his army melt away before his eyes, 
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q944910">Kaledin</persName>
            blew out his brains. And the Cossack movement was no more....</p>

         <p>Meanwhile at Moghilev were gathered the old<foreign xml:lang="ru">Tsay-ee-kah</foreign> the "moderate" Socialist
            leaders-from Avksentiev to Tchernov-the active chiefs of the old Army Committees, and
            the reactionary officers. The Staff steadily refused to recognise the Council of
            People's Commissars. It had united about it the Death Battalions, the Knights of St.
            George, and the Cossacks of the Front, and was in close and secret touch with the Allied
            military attachès, and with the <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q944910">Kaledin
            </persName>movement and the Ukrainean Rada....</p>

         <p>The Allied Governments had made no reply to the Peace decree of November 8th, in which
            the Congress of Soviets had asked for a general armistice.</p>

         <p>On November 20th <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33391">Trotzky</persName>
            addressed a note to the Allied Ambassadors: <ref target="#XI_18"></ref>(See App. XI, Sect. 18)</p>
            
            <quote>
                <p>I have the honour to inform you, Mr. Ambassador, that the All-Russian Congress of
                   Soviets... on November 8th constituted a new Government of the Russian Republic, in the
                   form of the Council of People's Commissars. The President of this Government is

                   The direction of Foreign Affairs has been entrusted to me, People's
                   Commissar for Foreign Affairs....</p>
       
                <p>In drawing your attention to the text, approved by the All-Russian Congress, of the
                   proposition for an armistice and a democratic peace without annexations or indemnities,
                   based on the right of self-determination of peoples, I have the honour to request you to
                   consider that document as a formal proposal of an immediate armistice on all fronts, and
                   the opening of immediate peace negotiations; a proposal which the authorised Government
                   of the Russian Republic addresses at the same time to all the belligerent peoples and
                   their Governments.</p>
       
                <p>Please accept, Mr. Ambassador, the profound assurance of the esteem of the Soviet
                   Government toward your people, who cannot but wish for peace, like all the other peoples
                   exhausted and drained by this unexampled butchery....</p>

         <p>The same night the Council of People's Commissars telegraphed to General<persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1356009">Dukhonin</persName>:</p>
            
            <quote>
               <p>... The Council of People's Commissars considers it indispensable without delay to make
                  a formal proposal of armistice to all the powers, both enemy and Allied. A declaration
                  conforming to this decision has been sent by the Commissar for Foreign Affairs to the
                  representatives of the Allied powers at Petrograd.</p>
      
               <p>The Council of People's Commissars orders you, Citizen Commander,... to propose to the

                  for peace.</p>
      
               <p>In charging you with the conduct of these preliminary pourparlers, the Council of

         <p>The Allied Ambassadors received <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33391">Trotzky</persName>'s
            note with contemptuous silence, accompanied by
            anonymous interviews in the newspapers, full of spite and ridicule. The order to
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1356009">Dukhonin</persName>
            was characterised openly as an act of treason....</p>

         <p>As for<persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1356009">Dukhonin</persName>,
            he gave no sign. On the night of November 22nd he was communicated with
            by telephone, and asked if he intended to obey the order. 
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1356009">Dukhonin</persName>answered that he
            could not, unless it emanated from <said who="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1356009">
            "a Government sustained by the Army and the country."</said></p>

         <p>By telegraph he was immediately dismissed from the post of Supreme Commander, and
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1346112">Krylenko</persName> appointed in his place.
            Following his tactics of appealing to the masses,
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394">Lenin</persName>
            sent a radio to all regimental, divisional and corps Committees, to all soldiers and
            sailors of the Army and the Fleet, acquainting them with 
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1356009">Dukhonin</persName>'s refusal, and
            ordering that "the regiments on the front shall elect delegates to begin negotiations
            with the enemy detachments opposite their positions...."</p>

         <p>On the 23d, the military attaches of the Allied nations, acting on instructions from
            their Governments, presented a note to 
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1356009">Dukhonin</persName>, 
            in which he was solemnly warned not to
            "violate the conditions of the treaties concluded between the Powers of the Entente."
            The note went on to say that if a separate armistice with Germany were concluded, that
            act "would result in the most serious consequences" to Russia. This communication
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1356009">Dukhonin</persName> at once
            sent out to all the soldiers' Committees....</p>

         <p>Next morning <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33391">Trotzky</persName> 
            made another appeal to the troops, characterising the note of the
            Allied representatives as a flagrant interference in the internal affairs of Russia, and
            a bald attempt "to force by threats the Russian Army and the Russian people to continue
            the war in execution of the treaties concluded by the Tsar...."</p>

         <p>From Smolny poured out proclamation after proclamation, (See App. XI, Sect. 19)
            denouncing <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1356009">Dukhonin</persName> 
            and the counter-revolutionary officers about him, denouncing the
            reactionary politicians gathered at Moghilev, rousing, from one end of the thousand-mile
            Front to the other, millions of angry, suspicious soldiers. And at the same time
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1346112">Krylenko</persName>, accompanied
            by three detachments of fanatical sailors, set out for the <foreign xml:lang="ru">Stavka</foreign>,
            breathing threats of vengeance, <ref target="#XI_20">(See App. XI, Sect. 20)</ref> 
            and received by the soldiers everywhere with tremendous ovations-a 
            triumphal progress. The Central Army Committee issued a declaration in favour of 
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1356009">Dukhonin</persName>
            ; and at once ten thousand troops moved upon Moghilev....</p>

         <p>On December 2d the garrison of Moghilev rose and seized the city, arresting 
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1356009">Dukhonin</persName>and
            the Army Committee, and going out with victorious red banners to meet the new Supreme
            Commander. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1346112">Krylenko</persName>
            entered Moghilev next morning, to find a howling mob gathered about
            the railway-car in which 
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1356009">Dukhonin</persName>
            had been imprisoned. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1346112">Krylenko</persName>
            made a speech in which he implored the soldiers not to harm
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1356009">Dukhonin</persName>,
            as he was to be taken to Petrograd and
            judged by the Revolutionary Tribunal. When he had finished, suddenly
            <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1356009">Dukhonin</persName>himself
            appeared at the window, as if to address the throng. But with a savage roar the people
            rushed the car, and falling upon the old General, dragged him out and beat him to death
            on the platform....</p>

            <p>So ended the revolt of the <foreign xml:lang="ru">Stavka</foreign>....</p>

         <p>Immensely strengthened by the collapse of the last important stronghold of hostile
            military power in Russia, the Soviet Government began with confidence the organisation
            of the state. Many of the old functionaries flocked to its banner, and many members of
            other parties entered the Government service. The financially ambitious, however, were
            checked by the decree on Salaries of Government Employees, fixing the salaries of the
            People's Commissars-the highest-at five hundred rubles (about fifty dollars) a month....
            The strike of Government Employees, led by the Union of Unions, collapsed, deserted by
            the financial and commercial interests which had been backing it. The bank clerks
            returned to their jobs....</p>

         <p>With the decree on the Nationalisation of Banks, the formation of the Supreme Council of
            People's Economy, the putting into practical operation of the Land decree in the
            villages, the democratic reorganisation of the Army, and the sweeping changes in all
            branches of the Government and of life,-with all these, effective only by the will of
            the masses of workers, soldiers and peasants, slowly began, with many mistakes and
            hitches, the moulding of proletarian Russia.</p>

         <p>Not by compromise with the propertied classes, or with the other political leaders; not
            by conciliating the old Government mechanism, did the Bolsheviki conquer the power. Nor
            by the organized violence of a small clique. If the masses all over Russia had not been
            ready for insurrection it must have failed. The only reason for Bolshevik success lay in
            their accomplishing the vast and simple desires of the most profound strata of the
            people, calling them to the work of tearing down and destroying the old, and afterward,
            in the smoke of falling ruins, cooperating with them to erect the frame-work of the
            new....</p>
