               adopted or were given this name, because they consented to the continuation of the
               war under Allied leadership, on the ground that it was a war of National Defence. The

               (Martov’s faction), and the Social Democrats Internationalists (Gorky’s group) were
               in favour of forcing the Allies to declare democratic war-aims, and to offer peace to

            <p>In spite of numerous stories of gigantic advances in wages immediately following the
               Revolution of March, 1917, these figures, which were published by the Ministry of
               Labour as characteristic of conditions all over Russia, show that wages did not rise
               immediately after the Revolution, but little by little. On an average, wages
               increased slightly more than 500 per cent….</p>
            <p>But at the same time the value of the ruble fell to less than one-third its former
               purchasing power, and the cost of the necessities of life increased enormously. </p>
            <p>The following table was compiled by the Municipal Duma of Moscow, where food was
               cheaper and more plentiful than in Petrograd: </p>

            <p>On an average, the above categories of necessities increased about 1,109 per cent in
               price, more than twice the increase of salaries. The difference, of course, went into

               industrial worker—for example, a steel-worker in the Putilov Factory—was about 8
               rubles. At the same time, profits were enormous…. I was told by one of the owners of
               the Thornton Woollen Mills, an English concern on the outskirts of Petrograd, that
               while wages had increased about 300 per cent in his factory, his profits had gone up

            <head>THE SOCIALIST MINISTERS</head>
            <p>The history of the efforts of the Socialists in the Provisional Government of July to
               realise their programme in coalition with the bourgeois Ministers, is an illuminating
               example of class struggle in politics. Says Lenin, in explanation of this phenomenon: </p>
            <p>“The capitalists, … seeing that the position of the Government was untenable,
                  resorted to a method which since 1848 has been for decades practised by the
                  capitalists in order to befog, divide, and finally overpower the working-class.
                  This method is the so-called ‘Coalition Ministry,’ composed of bourgeois and of
                  renegades from the Socialist camp.</p>
            <p>“In those countries where political freedom and democracy have existed side by
                  side with the revolutionary movement of the workers—for example in England and
                  France—the capitalists make use of this subterfuge, and very successfully too. The
                  ‘Socialist’ leaders, upon entering the Ministries, invariably prove mere
                  figure-heads, puppets, simply a shield for the capitalists, a tool with which to
                  defraud the workers. The ‘democratic’ and ‘republican’ capitalists in Russia set
                  in motion this very same scheme. The Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviki fell
                  victim to it, and on June 1st a ‘Coalition’ Ministry, with the participation of
                  Tchernov, Tseretelli, Skobeliev, Avksentiev, Savinkov, Zarudny and Nikitin became
                  an accomplished fact….”<hi rend="italic">Problems of the

            <p>September 18th. The Cadet Shulgin, writing in a Kiev newspaper, said that the
               Provisional Government’s declaration that Russia was a Republic constituted a gross
               abuse of its powers.“We cannot admit either a Republic, or the present
                  Republican Government…. And we are not sure that we want a Republic in
                  Russia….”</p>
            <p>October 23d. At a meeting of the Cadet party held at Riazan, M. Dukhonin declared,
                  <said>“On March 1st we must establish a Constitutional Monarchy. We must not
                  reject the legitimate heir to the throne, Mikhail Alexandrovitch….”</said></p>
            <p>October 27th. Resolution passed by the Conference of Business Men at Moscow:</p>
            <p>"The Conference… insists that the Provisional Government take the following immediate
               measures in the Army: </p>

               propagandists punished….</p>
            <p><num>3</num>The function of the Army Committees must be limited to economic
               questions exclusively. All their decisions should be confirmed by their superior
               officers, who have the right to dissolve the Committees at any time….</p>
            <p><num>4</num>The salute to be reestablished, and made obligatory. Full
               reestablishment of disciplinary power in the hands of officers, with right of review
               of sentence….</p>
            <p><num>5</num>Expulsion from the Corps of Officers of those who dishonour it by
               participating in the movement of the soldier-masses, which teaches them
               disobedience…. Reestablishment for this purpose of the Courts of Honor….</p>
            <p><num>6</num>The Provisional Government should take the necessary measures to make
