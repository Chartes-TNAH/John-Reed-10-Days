               <p><title>KERENSKY’S ADVANCE</title></p>
               <p>On November 9th Kerensky and his Cossacks arrived at Gatchina, where the
                  garrison, hopelessly split into two factions, immediately surrendered. The
                  members of the Gatchina Soviet were arrested, and at first threatened with
                  death; later they were released on good behaviour.</p>
               <p> The Cossack advance-guards, practically unopposed, occupied Pavlovsk,
                  Alexandrovsk and other stations, and reached the outskirts of Tsarskoye Selo
                  next morning—November 10th. At once the garrison divided into three
                  groups—the officers, loyal to Kerenskly; part of the soldiers and
                  non-commissioned officers, who declared themselves “neutral”; and most of
                  the rank and file, who were for the Bolsheviki. The Bolshevik soldiers, who
                  were without leaders or organisation, fell back toward the capital. The
                  local Soviet also withdrew to the village of Pulkovo.</p>
               <p>From Pulkovo six members of the Tsarskoye Selo Soviet went with an
                  automobile-load of proclamations to Gatchina, to propagandise the Cossacks.
                  They spent most of the day going around Gatchina from one Cossack barracks
                  to another, pleading, arguing and explaining. Toward evening some officers
                  discovered their presence and they were arrested and brought before General
                  Krasnov, who said, “You fought against Kornilov; now you are opposing
                  Kerensky. I’ll have you all shot!”</p>
               <p>After reading aloud to them the order appointing him
                  commander-in-chief of the Petrograd District, Krasnov asked if they
                  were Bolsheviki. They replied in the affirmative—upon which Krasnov
                  went away; a short time later an officer came and set them free,
                  saying that it was by order of General Krasnov….</p>
               <p>In the meanwhile delegations continued to arrive from Petrograd; from
                  the Duma, the Committee for Salvation, and, last of all, from <hi
                     rend="italic">the Vikzhel</hi>. The Union of Railway Workers insisted
                  that some agreement be reached to halt the civil war, and demanded that
                  Kerensky treat with the Bolsheviki, and that he stop the advance on
                  Petrograd. In case of refusal,the <hi rend="italic">Vikzhel</hi> threatened
                  a general strike at midnight of November 11th.</p>
               <p>Kerensky asked to be allowed to discuss the matter with the Socialist
                  Ministers and with the Committee for Salvation. He was plainly
                  undecided.</p>
               <p>On the 11th Cossack outposts reached Krasnoye Selo, from which the local
                  Soviet and the heterogeneous forces of the Military Revolutionary Committee
                  precipitately retired, some of them surrendering…. That night they also
                  touched Pulkovo, where the first real resistance was encountered….</p>
               <p>Cossacks deserters began to dribble into Petrograd, declaring that Kerensky
                  had lied to them, that he had spread broadcast over the front proclamations
                  which said that Petrograd was burning, that the Bolsheviki had invited the
                  Germans to come in, and that they were murdering women and children and
                  looting indiscriminately…. The Military Revolutionary Committee immediately
                  sent out some dozens of “agitators,” with thousands of printed appeals, to
                  inform the Cossacks of the real situation….</p>

               <p>“To All Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies.</p>
               <p>“The All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’
                  Deputies charges the local Soviets immediately to take the most energetic
                  measures to oppose all counter-revolutionary anti-Semitic disturbances, and
                  all pogroms of whatever nature. The honour of the workers’, peasants’ and
                  soldiers’ Revolution cannot tolerate any disorders….</p>
               <p>“The Red Guard of Petrograd, the revolutionary garrison and the sailors have
                  maintained complete order in the capital.</p>
               <p>“Workers, soldiers, and peasants, everywhere you should follow the example of
                  the workers and soldiers of Petrograd.</p>
               <p>“Comrades soldiers and Cossacks, on us falls the duty of keeping real
                  revolutionary order. </p>
               <p>“All revolutionary Russia and the whole world have their eyes on you….”</p>
               <p>“The All-Russian Congress of Soviets decrees:</p>
               <p>“To abolish capital punishment at the Front, which was reintroduced by
                  Kerensky.</p>
               <p>“Complete freedom of propaganda is to be re-established in the country. All
                  soldiers and revolutionary officers now under arrest for so-called political
                  ‘crimes’ are at once to be set free.”</p>
               <p> “The ex-Premier Kerensky, overthrown by the people, refuses to submit to the
                  Congress of Soviets and attempts to struggle against the legal Government
                  elected by the All-Russian Congress—the Council of People’s Commissars. The
                  Front has refused to aid Kerensky. Moscow has rallied to the new Government.
                  In many cities (Minsk, Moghilev, Kharkov) the power is in the hands of the
                  Soviets. No infantry detachment consents to march against the Workers’ and
                  Peasants’ Government, which, in accord with the firm will of the Army and
                  the people, has begun peace negotiations and has given the land to the
                  peasants….</p>
               <p>“We give public warning that if the Cossacks do not halt Kerensky, who has
                  deceived them and is leading them against Petrograd, the revolutionary
                  forces will rise with all their might for the defence of the precious
                  conquests of the Revolution—Peace and Land.</p>
               <p>“Citizens of Petrograd! Kerensky fled from the city, abandoning the authority
                  to Kishkin, who wanted to surrender the capital to the Germans; Rutenburg,
                  of the Black Band, who sabotaged the Municipal Food Supply; and Paltchinsky,
                  hated by the whole democracy. Kerensky has fled, abandoning you to the
                  Germans, to famine, to bloody massacres. The revolting people have arrested
                  Kerensky’s Ministers, and you have seen how the order and supplying of
                  Petrograd at once improved. Kerensky, at the demand of the aristocrat
                  proprietors, the capitalists, speculators, marches against you for the
                  purpose of giving back the land to the land-owners, and continuing the hated
                  and ruinous war. </p>
               <p>“Citizens of Petrograd! We know that the great majority of you are in favour
                  of the people’s revolutionary authority, against the Kornilovtsi led by
                  Kerensky. Do not be deceived by the lying declarations of the impotent
                  bourgeois conspirators, who will be pitilessly crushed. </p>
               <p>“Workers, soldiers, peasants! We call upon you for revolutionary devotion and
                  discipline. “Millions of peasants and soldiers are with us. “The victory of
                  the people’s Revolution is assured!” </p>

                  Social Insurance of wage-workers, as well as of the town and village poor.
                  The Government of the Tsar, the proprietors and the capitalists, as well as
                  the Government of coalition and conciliation, failed to realise the desires
                  of the workers with regard to Social Insurance. The Workers’ and Peasants’
                  Government, relying upon the support of the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’
                  and Peasants’ Deputies, announces to the working-class of Russia and to the
                  town and village poor, that it will immediately prepare laws on Social
                  Insurance based on the formulas proposed by the Labour organisations:</p>
               <p><ref>1.</ref> Insurance for all wage-workers without exception, as well
                  as for all urban and rural poor. </p>

               <p>Citizens of Russia!</p>
               <p>With the insurrection of November 7th the working masses have won for the
                  first time the real power.</p>
               <p>The All-Russian Congress of Soviets has temporarily transferred this power
                  both to its Executive Committee and to the Council of People’s
                  Commissars.</p>
               <p> By the will of the revolutionary people, I have been appointed People’s
                  Commissar of Education.</p>
               <p>The work of guiding in general the people’s education, inasmuch as it remains
                  with the central government, is, until the Constituent Assembly meets,
                  entrusted to a Commission on the People’s Education, whose chairman and
                  executive is the People’s Commissar. Upon what fundamental propositions will
                  rest this State Commission? How is its sphere of competence determined? </p>

                     the struggle against this darkness. It must acquire in the shortest time
                     universal literacy, by organising a network of schools answering to the
                     demands of modern pedagogics; it must introduce universal, obligatory
                     and free tuition for all, and establish at the same time a series of
                     such teachers’ institutes and seminaries as will in the shortest time
                     furnish a powerful army of people’s teachers so necessary for the

                     to be transferred to the organs of local self-government. The
                     independent work of the workers, soldiers and peasants, establishing on
                     their own initiative cultural educational organisations, must be given
                     full autonomy, both by the State centre and the Municipal centres.</p>

                     of the laws already created by the Committee, a revision required by the
                     fact that in editing them the Committee had to take into account the
                     bourgeois spirit of previous Ministries, which obstructed it even in

                     educating the people—the masters of the country.</p>
                  <p>No one measure in the domain of the people’s education ought to be
                     adopted by any power without the attentive deliberation of those who
                     represent the pedagogues.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, a decision cannot by any means be reached exclusively
                     through the cooperation of specialists. This refers as well to reforms
                     of the institutes of general education.</p>
                  <p>The cooperation of the pedagogues with the social forces—this is how the
                     Commission will work both in its own constitution, in the State
                     Committee, and in all its activities.</p>
                  <p>As its first task the Commission considers the improvement of the
                     teachers’ status, and first of all of those very poor though almost most
                     important contributors to the work of culture—the elementary school
                     teachers. Their just demands ought to be satisfied at once and at any
                     cost. The proletariat of the schools has in vain demanded an increase of
                     salary to one hundred rubles per month. It would be a disgrace any
                     longer to keep in poverty the teachers of the overwhelming majority of
                     the Russian people. </p>
                  <p>But a real democracy cannot stop at mere literacy, at universal
                     elementary instruction. It must endeavour to organise a uniform secular
                     school of several grades. The ideal is, equal and if possible higher
                     education for all the citizens. So long as this idea has not been
                     realised for all, the natural transition through all the schooling
                     grades up to the university—a transition to a higher stage—must depend
                     entirely upon the pupil’s aptitude, and not upon the resources of his
                     family.</p>
                  <p>The problem of a genuinely democratic organisation of instruction is
                     particularly difficult in a country impoverished by a long, criminal,
                     imperialistic war; but the workers who have taken the power must
                     remember that education will serve them as the greatest instrument in
                     their struggle for a better lot and for a spiritual growth. However
                     needful it may be to curtail other articles of the people’s budget, the
                     expenses on education must stand high. A large educational budget is the
                     pride and glory of a nation. The free and enfranchised peoples of Russia
                     will not forget this.</p>
                  <p>The fight against illiteracy and ignorance cannot be confined to a
                     thorough establishment of school education for children and youths.
                     Adults, too, will be anxious to save themselves from the debasing
                     position of a man who cannot read and write. The school for adults must
                     occupy a conspicuous place in the general plan of popular instruction. </p>
                  <p><hi rend="italic">Instruction and Education</hi>: One must emphasise the
                     difference between instruction and education. </p>
                  <p>>Instruction is the transmission of ready knowledge by the teacher to his
                     pupil. Education is a creative process. The personality of the
                     individual is being “educated” throughout life, is being formed, grows
                     richer in content, stronger and more perfect.</p>
                  <p>The toiling masses of the people—the workmen, the peasants, the
                     soldiers—are thirsting for elementary and advanced instruction. But they
                     are also thirsting for education. Neither the government nor the
                     intellectuals nor any other power outside of themselves can give it to
                     them. The school, the book, the theatre, the museum, etc., may here by
                     only aids. They have their own ideas, formed by their social position,
                     so different from the position of those ruling classes and intellectuals
                     who have hitherto created culture. They have their own ideas, their own
                     emotions, their own ways of approaching the problems of personality and
                     society. The city labourer, according to his own fashion, the rural
                     toiler according to his, will each build his clear world-conception
                     permeated with the class-idea of the workers. There is no more superb or
                     beautiful phenomenon than the one of which our nearest descendants will
                     be both witnesses and participants: The building by collective Labour of
                     its own general, rich and free soul.</p>
                  <p>Instruction will surely be an important but not a decisive element. What
                     is more important here is the criticism, the creativeness of the masses
                     themselves; for science and art have only in some of their parts a
                     general human importance. They suffer radical changes with every
                     far-reaching class upheaval. </p>
                  <p>Throughout Russia, particularly among the city labourers, but also among
                     the peasants, a powerful wave of cultural educational movement has
                     arisen; workers’ and soldiers’ organisations of this kind are
                     multiplying rapidly. To meet them, to lend them support, to clear the
                     road before them is the first task of a revolutionary and popular
                     government in the domain of democratic education.</p>
                  <p><hi rend="italic">The Constituent Assembly</hi> will doubtless soon begin
                     its work. It alone can permanently establish the order of national and
                     social life in our country, and at the same time the general character
                     of the organisation of popular education.</p>
                  <p>Now, however, with the passage of power to the Soviets, the really
                     democratic character of the Constituent Assembly is assured. The line
                     which the State Commission, relying upon the State Committee, will
                     follow, will hardly suffer any modification under the influence of the
                     Constituent Assembly. Without pre-determining it, the new People’s
                     Government considers itself within its rights in enacting in this domain
                     a series of measures which aim at enriching and enlightening as soon as
                     possible the spiritual life of the country.</p>
                  <p><hi rend="italic">The Ministry</hi>: The present work must in the interim
                     proceed through the Ministry of the People’s Education. Of all the
                     necessary alterations in its composition and construction the State
                     Commission will have charge, elected by the Executive Committee of the
                     Soviets and the State Committee. Of course the order of State authority
                     in the domain of the people’s education will be established by the
                     Constituent Assembly. Until then, the Ministry must play the part of the
                     executive apparatus for both the State Committee and the State
                     Commission for People’s Education. </p>
                  <p>The pledge of the country’s safety lies in the cooperation of all its
                     vital and genuinely democratic forces.</p>
                  <p>We believe that the energetic effort of the working people and of the
                     honest enlightened intellectuals will lead the country out of its
                     painful crisis, and through complete democracy to the reign of Socialism
                     and the brotherhood of nations.</p>
