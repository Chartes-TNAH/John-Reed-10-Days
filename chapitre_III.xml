            <head>RESOLUTION OF THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES</head>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Workers’ Control </hi></p>
            <p><num>1</num>(See page 43)</p>
            <p><num>2</num>The organisation of Workers’ Control is a manifestation of the same
               healthy activity in the sphere of industrial production, as are party organisations
               in the sphere of politics, trade unions in employment, Cooperatives in the domain of
               consumption, and literary clubs in the sphere of culture.</p>
            <p><num>3</num>The working-class has much more interest in the proper and uninterrupted
               operation of factories… than the capitalist class. Workers’ Control is a better
               security in this respect for the interests of modern society, of the whole people,
               than the arbitrary will of the owners, who are guided only by their selfish desire
               for material profits or political privileges. Therefore Workers’ Control is demanded
               by the proletariat not only in their own interest, but in the interest of the whole
               country, and should be supported by the revolutionary peasantry as well as the
               revolutionary Army.</p>
            <p><num>4</num>Considering the hostile attitude of the majority of the capitalist class
               toward the Revolution, experience shows that proper distribution of raw materials and
               fuel, as well as the most efficient management of factories, is impossible without
               Workers’ Control.</p>
            <p><num>5</num>Only Workers’ Control over capitalist enterprises, cultivating the
               workers’ conscious attitude toward work, and making clear its social meaning, can
               create conditions favourable to the development of a firm self-discipline in labour,
               and the development of all labour’s possible productivity.</p>
            <p><num>6</num>The impending transformation of industry from a war to a peace basis, and
               the redistribution of labour all over the country, as well as among the different
               factories, can be accomplished without great disturbances only by means of the
               democratic self-government of the workers themselves…. Therefore the realisation of
               Workers’ Control is an indispensable preliminary to the demobilisation of
               industry.</p>
            <p><num>7</num>In accordance with the slogan proclaimed by the Russian Social Democratic
               Labour Party (Bolsheviki), Workers’ Control on a national scale, in order to bring
               results, must extend to all capitalist concerns, and not be organised accidentally,
               without system; it must be well-planned, and not separated from the industrial life
               of the country as a whole.</p>
            <p><num>8</num>The economic life of the country—agriculture, industry, commerce and
               transport—must be subjected to one unified plan, constructed so as to satisfy the
               individual and social requirements of the wide masses of the people; it must be
               approved by their elected representatives, and carried out under the direction of
               these representatives by means of national and local organisations.</p>
            <p><num>9</num>That part of the plan which deals with land-labour must be carried out
               under supervision of the peasants’ and land-workers’ organisations; that relating to
               industry, trade and transport operated by wage-earners, by means of Workers’ Control;
               the natural organs of Workers’ Control inside the industrial plant will be the
               Factory-Shop and similar Committees; and in the labour market, the Trade Unions.</p>
            <p><num>10</num>The collective wage agreements arranged by the Trade Unions for the
               majority of workers in any branch of labour, must be binding on all the owners of
               plants employing this kind of labour in the given district.</p>
            <p><num>11</num>Employment bureaus must be placed under the control and management of
               the Trade Unions, as class organisations acting within the limits of the whole
               industrial plan, and in accordance with it.</p>
            <p><num>12</num>Trade Unions must have the right, upon their own initiative, to begin
               legal action against all employers who violate labour contracts or labour
               legislation, and also in behalf of any individual worker in any branch of labour.</p>
            <p><num>13</num>On all questions relating to Workers’ Control over production,
               distribution and employment, the Trade Unions must confer with the workers of
               individual establishments through their Factory-Shop Committees.</p>
            <p><num>14</num>Matters of employment and discharge, vacations, wage scales, refusal of
               work, degree of productivity and skill, reasons for abrogating agreements, disputes
               with the administration, and similar problems of the internal life of the factory,
               must be settled exclusively according to the findings of the Factory-Shop Committee,
               which has the right to exclude from participation in the discussion any members of
               the factory administration.</p>
            <p><num>15</num>The Factory-Shop Committee forms a commission to control the supplying
               of the factory with raw materials, fuel, orders, labour power and technical staff
               (including equipment), and all other supplies and arrangements, and also to assure
               the factory’s adherence to the general industrial plan. The factory administration is
               obliged to surrender to the organs of Workers’ Control, for their aid and
               information, all data concerning the business; to make it possible to verify this
               data, and to produce the books of the company upon demand of the Factory-Shop
               Committee.</p>
            <p><num>16</num>Any illegal acts on the part of the administration discovered by the
               Factory-Shop Committees, or any suspicion of such illegal acts, which cannot be
               investigated or remedied by the workers alone, shall be referred to the district
               central organisation of Factory-Shop Committees charged with the particular branch of
               labour involved, which shall discuss the matter with the institutions charged with
               the execution of the general industrial plan, and find means to deal with the matter,
               even to the extent of confiscating the factory.</p>
            <p><num>17</num>The union of the Factory-Shop Committees of different concerns must be
               accomplished on the basis of the different trades, in order to facilitate control
               over the whole branch of industry, so as to come within the general industrial plan;
               and so as to create an effective plan of distribution among the different factories
               of orders, raw materials, fuel, technical and labour power; and also to facilitate
               cooperation with the Trade Unions, which are organised by trades.</p>
            <p><num>18</num>The central city councils of Trade Unions and Factory-Shop Committees
               represent the proletariat in the corresponding provincial and local institutions
               formed to elaborate and carry out the general industrial plan, and to organise
               economic relations between the towns and the villages (workers and peasants). They
               also possess final authority for the management of Factory-Shop Committees and Trade
               Unions, so far as Workers’ Control in their district is concerned, and they shall
               issue obligatory regulations concerning workers’ discipline in the routine of
               production—which regulations, however, must be approved by vote of the workers
               themselves.</p>

            <head>THE BOURGEOIS PRESS ON THE BOLSHEVIKI</head>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Russkaya Volia</hi>, October 28. “The decisive moment approaches…. It is decisive
               for the Bolsheviki. Either they will give us… a second edition of the events of July
               16-18, or they will have to admit that with their plans and intentions, with their
               impertinent policy of wishing to separate themselves from everything consciously
               national, they have been definitely defeated….</p>
            <p>“What are the chances of Bolshevik success?</p>
            <p>“It is difficult to answer that question, for their principal support is the…
               ignorance of the popular masses. They speculate on it, they work upon it by a
               demagogy which nothing can stop….</p>
            <p>“The Government must play its part in this affair. Supporting itself morally by the
               Council of the Republic, the Government must take a clearly-defined attitude toward
               the Bolsheviki….</p>
            <p>“And if the Bolsheviki provoke an insurrection against the legal power, and thus
               facilitate the German invasion, they must be treated as mutineers and traitors….”</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Birzhevya Viedomosti</hi>, October 28. “Now that the Bolsheviki have separated
               themselves from the rest of the democracy, the struggle against them is very much
               simpler—and it is not reasonable, in order to fight against Bolshevism, to wait until
               they make a manifestation. The Government should not even allow the
               manifestation….</p>
            <p>“The appeals of the Bolsheviki to insurrection and anarchy are acts punishable by the
               criminal courts, and in the freest countries, their authors would receive severe
               sentences. For what the Bolsheviki are carrying on is not a political struggle
               against the Government, or even for the power; it is propaganda for anarchy,
               massacres, and civil war. This propaganda must be extirpated at its roots; it would
               be strange to wait, in order to begin action against an agitation for
                  <hi rend="italic">pogroms</hi>, until the pogroms actually occurred….”</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Novoye Vremya</hi>, November 1. “hellip; Why is the Government excited only about
               November 2d (date of calling of the Congress of Soviets), and not about September
               12th, or October 3d?</p>
            <p>“This is not the first time that Russia burns and falls in ruins, and that the smoke
               of the terrible conflagration makes the eyes of our Allies smart….</p>
            <p>“Since it came to power, has there been a single order issued by the Government for
               the purpose of halting anarchy, or has any one attempted to put out the Russian
               conflagration?</p>
            <p>“There were other things to do….</p>
            <p>“The Government turned its attention to a more immediate problem. It crushed an
               insurrection (the Kornilov attempt) concerning which every one is now asking, ‘Did it
               ever exist?”</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Dielo Naroda</hi>, October 28 (Socialist Revolutionary). “The most frightful
               crime of the Bolsheviki against the Revolution is that they impute exclusively to the
               bad intentions of the revolutionary Government all the calamities which the masses
               are so cruelly suffering; when as a matter of fact these calamities spring from
               objective causes.</p>
            <p>“They make golden promises to the masses, knowing in advance that they can fulfil
               none of them; they lead the masses on a false trail, deceiving them as to the source
               of all their troubles….</p>

               day they urge pogroms…. Is that ‘the freedom of the press’?…</p>
            <p>“The Government ought to defend itself and defend us. We have the right to insist
               that the Government machinery does not remain passive while the threat of bloody

            <p>The French newspaper <hi rend="italic">Entente</hi> of Petrograd, on November 15th, published an
               article of which the following is a part:</p>
            <p>“The Government of Kerensky discusses and hesitates. The Government of Lenin and

               adversaries. Conspirators—no!</p>
            <p>“No! They did not conspire. On the contrary, openly, audaciously, without mincing
               words, without dissimulating their intentions, they multiplied their agitation,
               intensified their propaganda in the factories, the barracks, at the Front, in the
               country, everywhere, even fixing in advance the date of their taking up arms, the

               <head>EVENTS OF THE NIGHT, NOVEMBER 6TH</head>
               <p>Toward evening bands of Red Guards began to occupy the printing shops of the
                  bourgeois press, where they printed <hi rend="italic">Rabotchi Put, Soldat</hi>, and various
                  proclamations by the hundred thousand. The City Militia was ordered to clear these
                  places, but found the offices barricaded, and armed men defending them. Soldiers
                  who were ordered to attack the print-shops refused.</p>
               <p>About midnight a Colonel with a company of <hi rend="italic">yunkers</hi> arrived at the club
                  “Free Mind,” with a warrant to arrest the editor of <hi rend="italic">Rabotchi Put</hi>.
                  Immediately an enormous mob gathered in the street outside and threatened to lynch
                  the <hi rend="italic">yunkers</hi>. The Colonel thereupon begged that he and the
                     <hi rend="italic">yunkers</hi> be arrested and taken to Peter-Paul prison for safety. This
                  request was granted.</p>
               <p>At 1 A. M. a detachment of soldiers and sailors from Smolny occupied the Telegraph
                  Agency. At 1.35 the Post Office was occupied. Toward morning the Military Hotel
                  was taken, and at 5 o’clock the Telephone Exchange. At dawn the State Bank was
                  surrounded. And at 10 A. M. a cordon of troops was drawn about the Winter
                  Palace.</p>
